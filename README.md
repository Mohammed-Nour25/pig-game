# 🎲 Pig (Dice Game) — TDD Project

> **Note:** This repository is a **skeleton** project — it contains no full implementation yet.  
> The goal is to enable team members to implement features (M1 / M2 / M3) in separate branches and pull requests following the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
The **Pig Dice Game** is a simple turn-based dice game implemented in **Python**.  
This project follows the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology — all features should be implemented by writing tests first, then adding the code that makes those tests pass.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Create your feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/m1-game-core-yourname
   ```

2. **Write tests first**, then implement the necessary code until all tests pass ✅  
3. Open a **Pull Request** and request a review.

---

## 🧰 Available Commands

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make test        # run tests (currently placeholders)
make lint        # run code linters (flake8 + pylint)
make doc         # generate API documentation in doc/api/
make uml         # generate UML diagrams in doc/uml/
```

## 🧩 Milestone Breakdown (Editable)

### M1 - Core Game & CLI
- Classes: `Game`, `Dice`, `Player` (optional: `DiceHand`)
- Command-line interface via `PigShell(cmd.Cmd)`
  - Commands: `start`, `roll`, `hold`, `status`, `name`, `rules`, `cheat`, `quit`
- Support for two players + CPU mode (optional)
- Unit tests with ≥90% coverage

### M2 - Highscore & AI
- AI intelligence levels (easy / medium / hard)
- Highscore management in JSON format
- New CLI commands: `ai`, `high`
- Integration with end-of-game events

### M3 - Documentation, UML, Linters, Coverage
- ≥90% test coverage
- Full code linting: flake8 / pylint / black
- Generate documentation with `pdoc` and UML with `pyreverse`
- Update README and presentation video
